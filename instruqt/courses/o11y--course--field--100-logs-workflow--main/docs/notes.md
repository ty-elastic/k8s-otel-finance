# A Modern Elasticsearch Logging Workflow

## Demo

* If you want to run this as a demo, you can use the Elasticsearch (breakout) tab in the first challenge with the full [script](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gB1zpSjFOMOZ0RTNgi_xJQSmoQQAzh-5/view?usp=drive_link). There are no hidden additional setup scripts that run in the subsequent challenges.

## Timing

If you need to shorten the course, drop (probably in this order):

1) RBAC: all of Challenge 6
2) New UA Alert using Transforms: last part of Challenge 5
3) Reporting and RBAC: all of Challenge 5
